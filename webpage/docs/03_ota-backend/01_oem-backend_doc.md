# OEM Backend Architecture for OTA Updates

The OEM backend architecture is fundamentally composed of three tightly integrated elements that work in concert to enable over-the-air (OTA) software updates for vehicles. These core components are update management, device management, and campaign management. Each element serves a distinct yet interconnected purpose within the OTA ecosystem, forming a comprehensive framework for managing the entire lifecycle of software deployments from development to vehicle delivery.

## Update Management

Update management serves as the foundational component responsible for handling all software artifacts generated by development and engineering teams. This system manages the complete lifecycle of software packages, including firmware images, software binaries, and their associated metadata. The process begins when development teams complete and validate software updates, after which these artifacts are uploaded to the cloud infrastructure through the update management system.

The update management component defines critical parameters for each software release, including the specific version being deployed, the type of issue or enhancement it addresses, communication protocols for release notes, and the complete set of files that must be stored in the cloud repository. This encompasses comprehensive version control, detailed release documentation, categorization of update types, and management of any dependencies between different software components. The system ensures that only validated and approved software packages enter the distribution pipeline, maintaining integrity and security throughout the update process.

## Device Management

Device management functions as the central repository and control system for organizing and maintaining comprehensive vehicle and ECU (Electronic Control Unit) information. This component tracks the entire fleet of vehicles, including their specific configurations, installed ECU types, and current software versions across all control units. The device management system maintains detailed inventories of vehicle variants, ECU configurations, and the software mapping relationships that determine which updates are compatible with which vehicles.

When a software issue is identified and an update package is prepared through update management, the device management component becomes responsible for determining the precise deployment targets. This involves analyzing which ECUs require the update, identifying compatible vehicle models and variants, and establishing the mapping between the software package and eligible target devices. The system maintains real-time visibility into the software version status across the entire fleet, enabling precise targeting of updates based on vehicle configuration, hardware compatibility, and current software states.

## Campaign Management

Campaign management provides the orchestration layer that controls and monitors the entire update rollout process. This component enables OEMs to create, execute, and track update campaigns across the vehicle fleet with granular control over deployment parameters. The system supports multiple concurrent campaigns, each with its own targeting criteria, schedule, and monitoring dashboard. Campaign management serves as the central nervous system for OTA operations, providing visibility into update progress, success rates, failure scenarios, and real-time vehicle status throughout the deployment process.

The campaign management framework includes sophisticated dashboards that display comprehensive metrics about update progress, including the number of vehicles successfully updated, those encountering issues, and those pending updates. The cloud platform continuously updates campaign data based on real-time feedback received from vehicles, creating a dynamic view of the entire rollout operation. Campaigns can be configured with various delivery strategies, including immediate deployment or scheduled rollouts, and can target specific geographic regions, countries, or vehicle subsets. The system tracks the scope of each campaign, monitoring how many vehicles are affected by a particular issue and ensuring appropriate coverage of the deployment.

## System Integration and Data Flow

The three core components of the OEM backend operate in a tightly integrated manner, with each component depending on and feeding information to the others. The OTA update process begins with update management registering a new software package that has been validated and approved for deployment. Once the software is registered, device management analyzes the package requirements and determines which ECUs, vehicle models, and variants are eligible to receive the update. This mapping process ensures compatibility and prevents deployment of incompatible software to vehicles.

    subgraph "External Systems"
        DEV["Development Teams"]

    end

    CM -- "Campaign Configuration" --> VEH
    VEH -- "Status Feedback" --> CM
    UM -- "Artifact Storage" --> CLOUD
    DM -- "Device Inventory" --> CM
```

Campaign management then takes the mapped software and device information to create and execute deployment campaigns. The campaign framework orchestrates the delivery of updates to targeted vehicles, managing the timing, sequencing, and monitoring of each deployment. Throughout this process, the three components maintain continuous data exchange, with update management providing software details, device management supplying target information, and campaign management coordinating the actual deployment operations.

## Communication Architecture

The communication between the OEM backend and vehicles during campaign execution primarily utilizes MQTT messaging through the Telematics Control Unit (TCU). This communication framework handles all interactions between the cloud platform and vehicles, including initial notifications about available updates, triggers to begin the update process, acknowledgments of receipt, and ongoing status updates throughout the installation procedure.

The MQTT-based communication system ensures reliable and efficient message delivery, supporting the bidirectional flow of information required for successful OTA operations. Campaign management relies on this communication channel to maintain real-time visibility into update progress, receive installation status reports, and handle any error conditions or rollback scenarios that may occur during the update process. The messaging framework is designed to handle the scale of fleet-wide deployments while maintaining the reliability and security required for automotive software updates.

## OTA Update Process Workflow

The complete OTA update process follows a structured workflow that leverages all three backend components in sequence. The process begins when development teams complete software validation and upload the package through update management. The system then registers the software, catalogs all associated files and metadata, and makes it available for deployment.

```kroki-mermaid {display-width=300px display-align=center}

    _1_Start["Software Development Complete"] --> _2_Validation
    _2_Validation["Software Validation"] --> _3_Upload

    _8_Execution["Campaign Execution"] --> _9_Monitoring
    _9_Monitoring["Progress Monitoring"] --> _10_Completion
    _10_Completion["Update Completion"]
```

Device management then analyzes the software requirements and determines eligible targets based on ECU compatibility, vehicle variants, and current software versions. Once target mapping is complete, campaign management creates the deployment campaign with appropriate scheduling, targeting, and monitoring parameters. The campaign then executes, delivering updates to vehicles according to the defined rollout strategy while continuously monitoring progress and handling any issues that arise.

## Campaign Management Operations

Campaign management encompasses a comprehensive set of operations for controlling update deployments. The system supports multiple concurrent campaigns, each operating independently while sharing common backend resources. Campaign operations include creating new campaigns based on available software packages and target devices, configuring deployment parameters such as rollout speed and geographic targeting, and executing the actual delivery of updates to vehicles.

```

During campaign execution, the system continuously monitors update progress, collecting status reports from vehicles and updating dashboard metrics in real-time. Campaign management handles various deployment scenarios, including immediate updates for critical fixes, scheduled rollouts for routine updates, and phased deployments that gradually expand the target vehicle population. The system maintains comprehensive records of all campaign activities, enabling detailed analysis of deployment success rates, failure patterns, and overall update effectiveness.
