# User Experience (HMI & Mobile App) Questions

## In-Vehicle HMI

### **1. What is the primary role of the HMI (Human-Machine Interface) in the OTA ecosystem?**

Answer: To act as the communication bridge between the vehicle's technical OTA system and the driver.

Explanation:
The HMI is responsible for:
*   **Notification:** Informing the driver about available updates.
*   **Authorization:** Collecting user consent to proceed with the update.
*   **Status Reporting:** Displaying real-time progress (downloading, installing, completed).
*   **Feature Activation:** Informing users about new features enabled by the update.

### **2. How does the HMI handle "Non-Drivable" updates differently from "Drivable" ones?**

Answer: By enforcing strict vehicle preconditions and warning the user that the vehicle cannot be used during the update.

Explanation:
For non-drivable updates (which affect safety-critical systems), the HMI will typically:
*   Require the vehicle to be parked.
*   Display a clear warning that the vehicle will be inoperable for a specific duration.
*   Request explicit confirmation/consent from the user before starting the process.

## OEM Mobile Application

### **3. What is the advantage of using an OEM Mobile App for OTA updates when an in-vehicle HMI differs?**

Answer: It allows for remote monitoring, control, and notifications without requiring the user to be physically present in the vehicle.

Explanation:
Mobile apps extend the HMI's capabilities by:
*   Sending push notifications about updates when the user is away from the vehicle.
*   Allowing users to schedule updates for convenient times (e.g., overnight).
*   providing status updates (success/failure) remotely.
*   Supporting features like remote climate control or door locking which complement the connected experience.

### **4. Describe a "Two-Factor Authentication" scenario involved Mobile Apps and the Vehicle HMI for OTA.**

Answer: Optimizing security by requiring interaction on both the vehicle screen and the mobile app (e.g., scanning a QR code).

Explanation:
To ensure high security for critical updates, a workflow might involve:
1.  The Vehicle HMI displays a unique QR code for the update.
2.  The User must scan this QR code using the authenticated OEM Mobile App.
3.  The backend verifies this handshake before authorizing the vehicle to proceed with the installation. This proves physical presence and authorized account access.

## Feature Enablement

### **5. How do OTA updates contribute to "Feature Enablement" and what is the HMI's role in it?**

Answer: OTA can unlock software-defined features post-production, and the HMI is responsible for introducing and activating them for the user.

Explanation:
Manufacturers can deliver new capabilities (e.g., improved ADAS, new lighting signatures, or infotainment apps) via software. The HMI plays a crucial role in "selling" or explaining these new features to the user after the update is complete, often prompting them to activate or configure the new settings.
