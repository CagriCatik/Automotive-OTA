# Global Regulatory Landscape

To sell a connected vehicle today, you need more than just crash test certification. You need **Cybersecurity Type Approval**.

## UNECE (Europe, Japan, Korea, Australia)

### UN R155 (Cybersecurity - CSMS)

- Mandates a **Cybersecurity Management System**.
- OEM must prove they can detect and respond to cyberattacks.
- **Enforcement:** July 2022 (New Types), July 2024 (All Registrations).
- **Key:** "Security by Design" is legally required.

### UN R156 (Software Update - SUMS)

- Mandates a **Software Update Management System**.
- **RXSWIN:** The software fingerprint of the type-approved vehicle.
- **Safe Execution:** Updates must fail safely.
- **Audit:** 10-year log retention.

## ISO Standards (The "How-To")

- **ISO/SAE 21434:** The bible of automotive cybersecurity. Defines the TARA (Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment) process.
- **ISO 24089:** Defines the engineering process for software updates.

## China (GB Standards)

China is the world's largest EV market and has its own strict rules.

- **GB/T 40856:** On-board vehicle gateway information security technical requirements.
- **GB/T 40857:** General technical requirements for vehicle software update.
- **Key Difference:** Data localization. OTA data for Chinese cars must remain on servers inside China.

## USA (NHTSA)

The US does not use the "Type Approval" system (Self-Certification).

- **NHTSA Cybersecurity Best Practices:** Guidelines, not hard laws (yet).
- **Right to Repair:** Massachusetts law requires OTA telematics data to be accessible to independent repair shops. This creates a massive security headache (Open API vs Secure System).
